Generative
===========
Generative is a header-only C++11 template library for compositioning coherent noise using the OpenGL Mathematics library (GLM).

Most C++ coherent noise libraries use a very object-heavy approach where you string objects together to create different kinds of coherent noise. Generative, on the other hand, uses a more function-oriented approach.
